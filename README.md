# Key Trustee AI app starter

This starter template makes it easy to create AI apps. You don't have to manage servers or API keys, meter usage or any of the stuff that gets in the way of creating amazing apps! All you need to do is configure your application in <a href="https://app.keytrustee.org">Key Trustee</a>, then update `./src/config.ts` with your application ID.

## Quickstart

It's as easy as:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Deploying

Once you're ready, deploying AI app starter applications is easy.

First build:

```bash
npm run build
```

Then serve the contents of the `dist` folder from anywhere!  We recommend GitHub pages.
